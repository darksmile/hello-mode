# Hello world Emacs major mode

Yes, looks very unusual. Just to realize how to create emacs mode and how to issue Emacs package (built-in linter is advanced and was really helpful).

## Installation

 * Clone repo (or just copy "hello.el" file)
 * Include hello.el file to your `.emacs` config

    (load "path/to/hello.el/file")

 * Enable hello major mode

    (hello-mode)

## Usage

Simply use `C-h h` key to print `"Hello, Emacs world!"` message to status line.
